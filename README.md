# VBA Excel Utilities
A series of small utility functions/subroutines that can be used to speed up tedious tasks, and improve workbook speed/size. 
Provided as .txt & .bas files 

### clear_conditional_formatting - Deletes all conditional formatting
Whilst conditional formats are a real time saver, they also tend to self-propagate when users copy data from one workbook to another (inadvertently copying the hidden conditional formatting as well), this can cause unexpected behaviour and contribute to workbook file size increases.  

### clear_formatting - Clears all cell formatting in a given workbook (excluding number formats)
Straightforward macro that loops through all sheets in a workbook removing cell formatting (colour, border, etc), leaves existing number format in place to avoid clearing date formats to numbers.

Macro contains options to adjust/remove conditional formatting & change cell alignment (commented out by default).

### clear_non_default_styles - Deletes all non-default styles. 
Non default styles can propagate through a workbook when there is a lot of copy/pasting between different workbooks. This in turn can lead to a increased file size and associated slowdown. "clear_non_default_styles" helps to eliminate one cause of slowdown.

### delete_connections - Loops through a workbook and deletes all data-connections. 
When importing files into excel (typically .csv) a connections is created, over time these can increase file size and slow performance.

### delete_named_ranges - Loops through a workbook and deletes all named ranges. 
Named ranges often build up in the background during day to day usage, this is made worst when using temporary formula/sheets to calculate results that are then hardcoded. This can over time increase file size and reduce overall performance deleting these ranges where they are not needed should improve performance.

### display_window_features - Toggles features (Formula Bar, Scroll Bar, Status Bar & Ribbon)
Useful if you need to prevent a user tinkering with the way a workbook is displayed/operates

### speed_up - Pre and post code subroutines that will generally speed up any macro
Turns off various excel features, such as screen updating and calculation to improve macro speed.
Also includes a separate subroutine with a boolean argument toggle to control these features with one line of code.

### factorial_calculator - Basic factorial calculator 
A useful example subroutine to use when benchmarking or when testing different profiling tools.

### simple_profiler - Provides a very simple timer
Useful for quick sense-check timings but not accurate enough for detailed analysis, can be used to hone in on problem areas of code that need refactoring/rewriting.
